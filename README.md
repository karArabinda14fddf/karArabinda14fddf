# Restaurant Insights Visualization Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and visualizations for a project aimed at providing insights for new and existing restaurant businesses using the Zomato dataset. The project focuses on three main tasks: identifying popular cuisines, performance analysis for existing restaurants, and assisting customers in making informed dining decisions.

## Task 1: Identifying Popular Cuisines (For New Restaurant Establishments)

### Solution

To address the first task, two visualizations were implemented - a stacked bar chart and a stacked line chart.

#### Stacked Bar Chart

In this visualization, the top 10 popular cuisines in the city are represented using a stacked horizontal bar chart. Each bar corresponds to a specific cuisine, with segments indicating the distribution of average ratings. The chart provides valuable insights into the popularity and average ratings of different cuisines.

##### Interpreting the Chart Results:

- Each bar represents a cuisine, and the height of the bar signifies the total number of restaurants serving that cuisine.
- Segments within the bar represent different average rating brackets, allowing users to understand the distribution of ratings for each cuisine.
- For example, the South Indian cuisine bar shows that there are more higher-rated restaurants than lower-rated ones.

##### Key Findings and Insights:

- The height of each bar provides information about the total number of existing restaurants for a specific cuisine, aiding new restaurant establishments in understanding competition and cuisine popularity.

#### Stacked Line Chart

## Task 2: Performance Analysis (Comparison-based)

### Solution

The second task involves a comparison-based performance analysis for existing restaurant businesses, using a doughnut chart and a heatmap.
